    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="files/yandacheng_profieimage.jpg" alt="Yanda Cheng" class="profile-pic">

    <p>
      I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Engineering at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, advised by Prof. Jun Xia. My research focuses on photoacoustic imaging, image denoising, deep learning, and intelligent vascular diagnostics. I specialize in developing advanced medical imaging technologies for chronic wound assessment and vascular health monitoring.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prior to my Ph.D., I earned a Master of Engineering degree in Biomedical Engineering from Cornell University, where I worked in Dr. Karl Lewisâ€™s lab. I also conducted research at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Kentucky, and Tsinghua University in the fields of signal processing, ultrasound, and biomedical image analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      My long-term goal is to enable photoacoustic imaging to become a clinically viable, AI-assisted diagnostic toolâ€”just as widely adopted as ultrasound. I am particularly passionate about improving real-world usability by developing explainable, automated diagnostic frameworks that integrate with electronic health systems.
